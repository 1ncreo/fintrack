## Local Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Run the following command to clone the project repository:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/1ncreo/fintrack.git)
cd fintrack
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Ensure `shadcn/ui` Components Are Installed

This project uses `shadcn/ui` for pre-built components. If the components are already included in the cloned repository, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you may need to add specific components by running:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button card form input label select tabs progress dialog toast
```

### 4. Set Up MongoDB

1. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account at [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
2. Create a new cluster.
3. Click "Connect" and choose "Connect your application."
4. Copy the connection string (it will look something like `mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`).

### 5. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with the connection string you copied from MongoDB Atlas.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Start the development server to test the application locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
